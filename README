This is the README file of the first GIT project.

The "trees" directory contains results of the "tree" utility (various depth values).
Branches:
  b202-$HOME
  b202-/tmp

Note: The URL for accessing the repo via git pull must be
url = git@github.com:hamy/FirstSteps01.git
url = https://.... does not work, dunno why...
Use this URL also for cloning, since the URL is stored in the "config" leaf of the .git directory.
